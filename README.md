# Bank Marketing Campaign Classification Model

## Description

This project builds a classification model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and past interaction data. The dataset is provided by a large bank aiming to optimize its phone marketing strategy by identifying potential customers more likely to subscribe to their term deposits.

The model evaluates the effectiveness of the bank's current marketing algorithms and provides insights for optimizing decision-making processes. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and analysis of results.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
- **Model Training**: Implement various classification algorithms like Random Forest to predict customer behavior.
- **Model Evaluation**: Analyze model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Insights for Decision-Making**: Identify key features influencing customer subscription rates and improve marketing strategies accordingly.
