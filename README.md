Project Title: Bank Marketing Campaign Classification Model
Description:
This project involves building a classification model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and past interaction data. The dataset is provided by a large bank aiming to optimize its phone marketing strategy by identifying potential customers who are more likely to subscribe to their term deposits.

The classification model uses machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.) to evaluate the effectiveness of the bank's current marketing algorithms and provides insights into optimizing decision-making processes. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and analysis of results.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Implementing various classification algorithms like Random Forest to predict customer behavior.
Model Evaluation: Analyzing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix metrics.
Insights for Decision-Making: Identify key features that influence customer subscription rates and improve marketing strategies accordingly.
